        <p>
            I am a Sophmore at Perrhy Highschool. My hobbies include <br>
            eating, sleeping, wasting my time, drawing, watching cartoons, <br>
            and making them dank memes. I have an interest in art, design, and computers,<br> 
            and hope to someday get a career in animation (I plan to suffer, basically). <br>
            I got interested in computer programming when I was in 8th grade, and was in a <br>
            not-so-great-robotics class. We hardly wrote any code in that class, but I was <br>
            immediately interested. Before that point I was only mildly interested in the subject.<br>
            In this class, I plan to learn as much as I can about JavaScript and HTML, since those two <br>
            languages seem to be the most useful in today's age. Although, it would be fun to learn as many languages as I can.
