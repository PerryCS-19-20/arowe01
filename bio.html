                <p id="description">
                    I am 15, and a Sophmore at Perry Highschool. My hobbies include eating, sleeping, wasting my time, 
                    drawing, watching cartoons, and making them dank memes. I have an interest in art, design, and computers, 
                    and hope to someday get a career in animation (I plan to suffer, basically). I got interested in 
                    computer programming when I was in 8th grade, and was in a not-so-great-robotics class. We hardly wrote any 
                    code in that class, but I was immediately interested. Before that point I was only mildly interested in the subject.
                    In this class, I plan to learn as much as I can about JavaScript and HTML, since those two languages seem to be the 
                    most useful in today's age. Although, it would be fun to learn as many languages as I can.
